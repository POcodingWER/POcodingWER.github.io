## Breadth-First Search (BFS) ?

**Breadth-First Search (BFS)** is an algorithm used to traverse or search through graph or tree structures. Unlike Depth-First Search (DFS), BFS explores all the nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This is accomplished using a queue to maintain the order of nodes to be visited.

#### **How BFS Works**:

1. Start at a given node, mark it as visited, and enqueue it.
2. Dequeue a node from the queue, and visit its unvisited neighboring nodes.
3. Enqueue those neighbors and repeat the process until all nodes are visited or the queue is empty.

#### **Applications**:

- **Shortest Path Finding**: BFS is ideal for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.
- **Level Traversal**: BFS is commonly used to traverse nodes level by level, especially in tree structures.
- **Connected Components**: BFS helps in identifying all nodes in the same connected component of a graph.

### **JavaScript Breadth-First Search Example**

```javascript
// Graph representation as an adjacency list
const graph = {
  0: [1, 2],
  1: [0, 3, 4],
  2: [0, 5],
  3: [1],
  4: [1, 5],
  5: [2, 4],
};

function bfs(graph, start) {
  let queue = [start]; // Queue initialized with the start node
  let visited = new Set(); // Set to store visited nodes
  visited.add(start); // Mark start node as visited

  while (queue.length > 0) {
    let node = queue.shift(); // Dequeue a node
    console.log(node); // Output the visited node

    // Explore neighbors
    for (let neighbor of graph[node]) {
      if (!visited.has(neighbor)) {
        // If neighbor hasn't been visited
        queue.push(neighbor); // Enqueue the neighbor
        visited.add(neighbor); // Mark neighbor as visited
      }
    }
  }
}

// Execute BFS starting from node 0
bfs(graph, 0); // Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
```

### **Rust Breadth-First Search Example**

```rust
use std::collections::{HashSet, VecDeque};

// BFS function
fn bfs(graph: &Vec<Vec<usize>>, start: usize) {
    let mut queue = VecDeque::new(); // Create a queue
    let mut visited = HashSet::new(); // Set to store visited nodes
    queue.push_back(start); // Enqueue the start node
    visited.insert(start); // Mark start node as visited

    while let Some(node) = queue.pop_front() {
        println!("{}", node); // Output the visited node

        // Explore neighbors
        for &neighbor in &graph[node] {
            if !visited.contains(&neighbor) { // If neighbor hasn't been visited
                queue.push_back(neighbor); // Enqueue the neighbor
                visited.insert(neighbor); // Mark neighbor as visited
            }
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    // Graph representation as an adjacency list
    let graph = vec![
        vec![1, 2],    // Neighbors of node 0
        vec![0, 3, 4], // Neighbors of node 1
        vec![0, 5],    // Neighbors of node 2
        vec![1],       // Neighbors of node 3
        vec![1, 5],    // Neighbors of node 4
        vec![2, 4]     // Neighbors of node 5
    ];

    bfs(&graph, 0); // Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
}
```

### Summary

Breadth-First Search (BFS) explores nodes in a graph or tree by visiting all the nodes at the current depth level before moving on to the nodes at the next depth. It uses a queue to keep track of the nodes yet to be visited, making it ideal for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs and level-wise traversal.
