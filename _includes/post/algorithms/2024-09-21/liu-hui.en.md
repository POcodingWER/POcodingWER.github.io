### What is Liu Hui's π Algorithm?

**Liu Hui's π algorithm** is an ancient Chinese algorithm developed by mathematician Liu Hui around 263 AD to calculate the value of π (pi). The method is based on the **inscribed polygon method**, originally proposed by Archimedes, but Liu Hui refined and extended it.

The idea behind the algorithm is to approximate the circumference of a circle by using polygons with an increasing number of sides inscribed within the circle. As the number of sides increases, the polygon becomes closer to the shape of the circle, and its perimeter approaches the circumference, which is proportional to π.

Liu Hui started with a hexagon inscribed inside a circle and calculated the perimeter. Then, he doubled the number of sides of the polygon (e.g., from 6 to 12, 24, 48, etc.), each time getting a better approximation of the circumference of the circle, and thus, π.

### Steps in Liu Hui's Algorithm

1. Begin with an inscribed polygon, such as a hexagon.
2. Double the number of sides at each iteration (from 6 to 12, 24, 48, and so on).
3. Calculate the perimeter of the polygon.
4. Use the perimeter to approximate the value of π. As the number of sides increases, the approximation becomes more accurate.

The relationship is expressed as:
$
\pi \approx \frac{P}{2r}
$
Where $P$ is the perimeter of the polygon, and $r$ is the radius of the circle.

### Applications of Liu Hui’s π Algorithm

1. **Geometry**: The algorithm gives a geometric understanding of the relationship between polygons and circles.
2. **History of Mathematics**: Liu Hui’s method is historically significant in the development of π calculations.
3. **Numerical Methods**: This method demonstrates iterative approximation, a concept widely used in numerical analysis today.
4. **Computer Graphics**: In modern times, polygon approximation of curves is a standard technique in computer graphics.

### JavaScript Implementation of Liu Hui's π Algorithm

```javascript
function liuHuiPi(steps) {
  let sides = 6; // Start with a hexagon
  let sideLength = 1; // Assume the radius is 1, the side length of hexagon is 1

  for (let i = 0; i < steps; i++) {
    let halfSide = Math.sqrt(1 - Math.pow(sideLength / 2, 2));
    sideLength = Math.sqrt(
      Math.pow(sideLength / 2, 2) + Math.pow(1 - halfSide, 2)
    );
    sides *= 2; // Double the number of sides
  }

  // Perimeter of the polygon
  const perimeter = sides * sideLength;

  // Pi approximation is perimeter divided by the diameter (2 * radius)
  return perimeter / 2;
}

console.log(liuHuiPi(10)); // Increase the steps for better approximation
```

### Rust Implementation of Liu Hui's π Algorithm

```rust
fn liu_hui_pi(steps: u32) -> f64 {
    let mut sides = 6.0; // Start with a hexagon
    let mut side_length = 1.0; // Assume the radius is 1, initial side length of hexagon

    for _ in 0..steps {
        let half_side = (1.0 - (side_length / 2.0).powi(2)).sqrt();
        side_length = ((side_length / 2.0).powi(2) + (1.0 - half_side).powi(2)).sqrt();
        sides *= 2.0; // Double the number of sides
    }

    // Perimeter of the polygon
    let perimeter = sides * side_length;

    // Pi approximation is perimeter divided by the diameter (2 * radius)
    perimeter / 2.0
}

fn main() {
    println!("{}", liu_hui_pi(10)); // Increase the steps for a better approximation
}
```

### Summary:

**Liu Hui's π Algorithm** provides an iterative geometric approach to approximate π by inscribing polygons inside a circle and increasing the number of sides. Each iteration gets a closer approximation of π. The algorithm is historically important and demonstrates principles used in modern numerical methods. Both JavaScript and Rust can efficiently implement this approach for approximating π.
