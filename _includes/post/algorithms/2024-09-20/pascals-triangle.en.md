### What is Pascal's Triangle?

**Pascal's Triangle** is a triangular array where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The first few rows of Pascal’s Triangle look like this:

```
       1
      1 1
     1 2 1
    1 3 3 1
   1 4 6 4 1
  1 5 10 10 5 1
```

In this triangle, each number is a **binomial coefficient**. The $n$-th row corresponds to the coefficients of the expansion of $(a + b)^n$, and it can also be computed using combinations:
$
nCk = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
$
Where $nCk$ is the value at row $n$ and position $k$.

### Use Cases of Pascal's Triangle

1. **Binomial Expansion**: Pascal’s Triangle provides the coefficients for expanding expressions like $(a + b)^n$.
2. **Combinatorics**: It helps calculate combinations, representing how to select $k$ elements from a set of $n$.
3. **Probability**: It is useful in probability theory when calculating the number of ways events can occur.
4. **Fractals**: Pascal's Triangle exhibits interesting fractal patterns, such as the Sierpinski triangle when viewed modulo 2.
5. **Dynamic Programming**: Used in optimization problems where previous results can help compute new results.

### Pascal's Triangle Implementation

You can generate Pascal’s Triangle using a simple nested loop. Each row starts and ends with 1, and the other values are calculated as the sum of two elements from the row above.

### JavaScript Example for Pascal's Triangle

```javascript
function generatePascalTriangle(numRows) {
  const triangle = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < numRows; i++) {
    triangle[i] = [];
    triangle[i][0] = 1; // First element is always 1
    triangle[i][i] = 1; // Last element is always 1

    for (let j = 1; j < i; j++) {
      // The value is the sum of the two values above it
      triangle[i][j] = triangle[i - 1][j - 1] + triangle[i - 1][j];
    }
  }

  return triangle;
}

// Example usage
console.log(generatePascalTriangle(5));
```

**Output:**

```
[
  [1],
  [1, 1],
  [1, 2, 1],
  [1, 3, 3, 1],
  [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]
]
```

### Rust Example for Pascal's Triangle

```rust
fn generate_pascal_triangle(num_rows: usize) -> Vec<Vec<u32>> {
    let mut triangle = vec![vec![1]; num_rows];

    for i in 1..num_rows {
        let mut row = vec![1; i + 1];

        for j in 1..i {
            row[j] = triangle[i - 1][j - 1] + triangle[i - 1][j];
        }

        triangle[i] = row;
    }

    triangle
}

fn main() {
    let triangle = generate_pascal_triangle(5);

    for row in triangle {
        println!("{:?}", row);
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
[1]
[1, 1]
[1, 2, 1]
[1, 3, 3, 1]
[1, 4, 6, 4, 1]
```

### Summary:

**Pascal's Triangle** is a simple yet powerful tool in combinatorics and binomial expansion. Each number in the triangle represents a binomial coefficient, and its values are widely used in problems involving combinations, probabilities, and dynamic programming. The triangle can be easily generated using loops in both JavaScript and Rust.
