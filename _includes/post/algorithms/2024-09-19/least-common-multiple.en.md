## Least Common Multiple (LCM)?

The **Least Common Multiple (LCM)** of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers. In other words, it is the smallest number that both integers divide without leaving a remainder.

For example:

- The LCM of 6 and 8 is 24 because 24 is the smallest number divisible by both 6 and 8.

### Formula to Calculate LCM

One of the most efficient ways to compute the LCM of two numbers is by using the relationship between the **LCM** and the **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**:

$
\text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{|a \times b|}{\text{GCD}(a, b)}
$

This formula leverages the Euclidean algorithm for GCD calculation and uses it to find the LCM efficiently.

### Where is LCM Used?

1. **Scheduling Problems**: LCM helps in finding when two repeating events will happen together again. For example, if two machines are scheduled to operate at intervals of `x` and `y` hours, the LCM helps in determining when both machines will be working simultaneously.
2. **Cryptography**: LCM is used in certain cryptographic algorithms like RSA for modulus calculation.
3. **Mathematics and Algebra**: LCM is often used in solving problems involving fractions, such as adding or subtracting fractions with different denominators.
4. **Computer Systems**: LCM helps in the design of system clocks and timekeeping to synchronize tasks or resources.

### Example of LCM in JavaScript

Here’s how you can compute the LCM of two numbers using JavaScript:

```javascript
function gcd(a, b) {
  while (b !== 0) {
    const remainder = a % b;
    a = b;
    b = remainder;
  }
  return a;
}

function lcm(a, b) {
  return Math.abs(a * b) / gcd(a, b);
}

console.log(lcm(6, 8)); // Outputs 24
console.log(lcm(12, 15)); // Outputs 60
```

### Example of LCM in Rust

Similarly, here’s an example of calculating the LCM in Rust:

```rust
fn gcd(mut a: u32, mut b: u32) -> u32 {
    while b != 0 {
        let remainder = a % b;
        a = b;
        b = remainder;
    }
    a
}

fn lcm(a: u32, b: u32) -> u32 {
    (a * b) / gcd(a, b)
}

fn main() {
    println!("{}", lcm(6, 8));  // Outputs 24
    println!("{}", lcm(12, 15));  // Outputs 60
}
```

### Summary:

The **Least Common Multiple (LCM)** is the smallest number that two integers divide without remainder. It is commonly used in scheduling, cryptography, and mathematical operations involving fractions. The LCM can be efficiently computed using the relationship between LCM and GCD, leveraging the Euclidean algorithm for GCD calculation. Both JavaScript and Rust offer simple and efficient ways to implement this.
