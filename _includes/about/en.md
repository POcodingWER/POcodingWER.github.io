I’m a passionate developer who thrives on the joy of creating and learning through development.<br/>
With over two years of hands-on experience, I've recently noticed a bit of a lull in my motivation. To reignite that spark, I'm diving into areas that fascinate me, one project at a time. Whether it's a new technology or a creative side project, I’m always eager to expand my skill set and collaborate with others who share my enthusiasm.

My journey began as a blockchain developer, specializing in Solidity, but I've since transitioned into the front-end world. I'm currently mastering Vue and React, and I love every minute of it.

I’m always open to studying together, exploring different fields, and building cool things on the side. If you’re interested in collaborating or just want to chat about development, feel free to reach out to me at <cjftns01@gmail.com>.
