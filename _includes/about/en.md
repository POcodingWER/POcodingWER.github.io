### Blockchain Developer & NFT Projects

**June 2022 ~ September 2022 (3 months)**

Through experience in Solidity-based smart contract development and NFT minting platform construction, I gained **deep understanding of blockchain technology and Web3 ecosystem**. Later transitioned to frontend development to deliver value to a broader user base.

**Key Projects:**

- **Delica NFT Minting Platform**: Solidity smart contract design and React-based frontend implementation
- **Bellygom NFT Project**: Ethereum-based NFT issuance system development

**Tech Stack:** Solidity, Web3.js, Ethereum, React, ethers.js

**Transition Reason:** After NFT market downturn, pivoted to frontend development to **provide substantial value to more users**. Blockchain development experience greatly helped with complex state management, asynchronous processing, and security issue handling.
